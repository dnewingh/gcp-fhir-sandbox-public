This is a common directory in many frameworks for basic input-output kind of functions that are reusable throughout the project. They are typically easy to unit test and usually end up being used more than once. I like to start with a single index.js file and then as the helpers grow, break them up into more grouped files like https.js, cache.js, time.js, etc. Everything in this directory can just be imported and used on demand and if a function ends up never being used at all it can be easily tree shaken from the production bundle.
